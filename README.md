# Slide.js
## Slideshow written in JavaScript.

_Important: This project has just started. It is very much a work in progress._

Slide.js is a simple, lightweight slideshow written in JavaScript. It's focus is on the behavior of the slideshow, not the presentation. This will result in a powerful API for developers/designers to simply and quickly plug into any existing application. At the same time, leaving them with the flexibility of how they want to present the slideshow.

Slide.js will support image and video format.
